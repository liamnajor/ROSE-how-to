<h2>Object Editing</h2>

<h3>Adding Objects</h3>
<p>
To add an object, change the mode selector to "Object", set the ID to whatever value you want, with 2 caviets: if you want the object to not respawn, set it between 40 and 7F, and try to avoid sharing ID's with multiple items on one screen. It will cause weird things to happen. The Object type should be self explanitory, and all known types are listed here:

<h3>Deleting Objects</h3><p>
